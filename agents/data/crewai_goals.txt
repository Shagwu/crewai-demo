My mission is to build CrewAI: a local, offline-first AI agent system that can help creators automate research, summarize content, and generate posts or podcast scripts. 

I want the system to:
1. Work with open-source models like GPT-4o, Claude, Qwen, and ERNIE.
2. Be able to read documents, browse the web (locally or via plugin), and extract insights.
3. Use CrewAI-style orchestration to let agents talk to each other and plan tasks.
4. Include tools like LlamaIndex and LangGraph for memory, context, and flow.
5. Output daily content like Instagram carousels, short scripts, and Notion posts.

This is not just a tool — it’s a creative research companion that helps me stay in flow, focused on wisdom and impact.
