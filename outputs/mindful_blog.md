# One Small Habit to Use Tech More Mindfully: The Hourly "Mindful Use" Session


In a world where screens have become the windows through which we interact with everything, it's easy for technology usage to spiral out of control. We find ourselves scrolling incessantly or checking emails at all hours when our phone buzzes—habits that can take away from truly living life offline and being present. But fear not! I have a simple habit you can adopt immediately to start using tech more mindfully, right now: the hourly "mindful use" session.


Here's how it works: once every hour for 30 seconds or so (just five minutes if that feels too long), stand up from your workstation and take a deliberate break away from all digital devices—yes, even smartwatches! Close the laptop, put down phones, tablets, you name them. Find somewhere comfortable to sit with no distractions in sight for about three full mindful breaths (that's five minutes of tech-free time right there).


During this mini breakout from your digital world, focus on being present—in the room or outdoors if you have access. Observe without judgment what is happening around and within you at that moment. Feelings will come up; welcome them as natural parts of our human experience but don't let any negative thoughts consume you for too long before returning to your workspace refreshed with a clearer mindset, ready to tackle the next task with intention rather than robotic efficiency.


The beauty here is that this habit can be seamlessly woven into even the busiest of schedules and doesn't require much space or time—just 30 seconds once an hour! Start your journey today towards a more mindful relationship with technology, which not only enhances our well-being but also enriches every aspect of life by fostering deeper connections when we are offline.


Remember to gently return from these sessions and continue working or engaging in other activities as normal—it's about balance, after all! Give it a try for just one day; I promise you won’t regret taking back control of your time with tech mindfully woven into the fabric of each hour.


Happy mindful living and happy technology use too!
